+ Do not make any unneccesary files and folders.
+ Do not run npm run dev and npm run build to check for errors.

Implement remaining task of task 3.2 and task 3.3 (when click chats in the dashboard from admin-dashboard folder). Read the task in TASKS.md, the current implementation of the widget in task 3.1 and 3.2 in the chat-widget folder and chat-widget/README.md, task 3.3 recommendation in docs/chat-widget-n8n-integration.md so you can apply the widget in your implementation if neccesary.

Use supabase MCP to read the current schema and RLS policies so you can implement appropriately.

Use brave MCP so you can fetch the latest documentation before every coding to avoid deprication.

After you implement the admin chat management interface, apply RBAC for roles like Chatbot Manager, Analyst/Reporter and Support Agent so they can only access functionality corresponding to their roles described in Chatbot_DoanhNghiep.md
