Implement remaining task of task 3.2 and task 3.3 (when click chats in the dashboard from admin-dashboard folder). Read the task in TASKS.md and the current implementation of the widget in task 3.1 and 3.2 in the chat-widget folder and chat-widget/README.md, task 3.3 recommendation in docs/chat-widget-n8n-integration.md so you can apply in your implementation.

Use supabase MCP to read the current schema and RLS policies so you can implement appropriately.

Use brave MCP so you can fetch the latest documentation before every coding to avoid deprication.

After you implement the admin chat management interface, apply RBAC for roles like Chatbot Manager, Analyst/Reporter and Support Agent so they can only access functionality corresponding to their roles described in Chatbot_DoanhNghiep.md

** Later
Pass knowledge base so that the chatbot only read documents from those knowledge base only
Check if first task of task 3.2 is okay
