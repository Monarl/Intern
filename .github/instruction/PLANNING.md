# Supabase MCP Server Project Planning

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a Python-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Supabase. The server will enable AI assistants and language models to directly interact with Supabase databases and services through a standardized interface.

## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that defines how AI tools and platforms communicate. It establishes a common protocol for language models to call functions, retrieve data, and execute tasks on external services like Supabase.

## What is Supabase?
Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative providing ready-to-use backend features including:
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication
- Auto-generated APIs
- Realtime subscriptions
- Storage
- Edge Functions

## Project Scope

### Core Functionality
1. **Database Operations**
   - Table querying with filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Data insertion, updating, and deletion
   - Transaction support
   - Schema introspection

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Secure connection to Supabase projects
   - Role-based access control
   - Managed security context

3. **MCP Protocol Implementation**
   - Standard-compliant tool definitions
   - Request/response handling
   - Error management
   - Context management

### Extended Features (Future Phases)
- Storage operations (file upload/download)
- Edge function execution
- Realtime subscriptions
- TypeScript/Python type generation
- Database migration handling

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **Supabase Client**: supabase-py
- **MCP Implementation**: Custom implementation based on MCP specifications
- **Deployment**: Docker container
- **Configuration**: Environment variables + YAML configuration

### Components
1. **MCP Server Core**
   - Protocol handling
   - Function registration
   - Request routing

2. **Supabase Connector**
   - Authentication
   - Connection pooling
   - API wrapping

3. **Tool Implementations**
   - Database tools
   - Auth tools
   - Schema tools

4. **Type System**
   - Type conversions
   - Schema definitions
   - Validation

## Development Approach
- Test-driven development
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive documentation
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Semantic versioning

## Security Considerations
- Environment-based secrets management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Restricted permissions model

## Integration Targets
- VS Code Agent Mode
- Claude
- GPT models with tool calling
- Anthropic Claude with MCP support
- Custom clients

## Success Metrics
- Number of supported Supabase operations
- Response time performance
- Ease of setup (measured by time to first successful query)
- Documentation completeness
