# Knowledge Base Management UI Implementation

## Overview

The Knowledge Base Management UI allows Super Admins and Knowledge Managers to create, view, and manage knowledge bases and their documents. This interface provides a user-friendly way to upload files, add URLs (including sitemaps), and manage existing documents.

## UI Components

### Knowledge Base Listing Page
- Path: `/dashboard/knowledge-bases`
- Features:
  - Card-based display of all knowledge bases
  - Create new knowledge base button
  - Per-KB statistics (document count)
  - Action buttons for each KB (upload file, add URL, view documents, delete)

### Knowledge Base Document Page
- Path: `/dashboard/knowledge-bases/[id]`
- Features:
  - List of all documents in a knowledge base
  - Document type indicators (file vs URL)
  - Document status display (processing, completed, error)
  - Delete document functionality

### Dialog Components
1. **NewKnowledgeBaseDialog**:
   - Create new knowledge bases
   - Fields: name, description

2. **UploadFileDialog**:
   - Multi-file upload with progress tracking
   - File type validation (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV)
   - Size limit enforcement (20MB per file)
   - Success/error status display

3. **UploadUrlDialog**:
   - Add URLs to knowledge bases
   - Toggle for sitemap processing
   - URL validation

4. **DeleteConfirmDialog**:
   - Confirmation for KB deletion
   - Warning about cascading deletions

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Progress Feedback**:
   - Per-file upload progress tracking
   - Status indicators (pending, uploading, success, error)
   - Disabled UI during operations
   - Toast notifications for success/failure

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - UI is only accessible to Super Admins and Knowledge Managers
   - Server-side validation of permissions

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Validation of input (file types, sizes, URL format)
   - Clear error messages
   - Recovery options

## Integration Points

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/knowledge-base/list` - Get all knowledge bases
   - `/api/knowledge-base` (POST) - Create a new knowledge base
   - `/api/knowledge-base/[id]` (DELETE) - Delete a knowledge base
   - `/api/knowledge-base/upload-file` - Upload files to a KB
   - `/api/knowledge-base/upload-url` - Add URL/sitemap to a KB
   - `/api/knowledge-base/document/[id]` (DELETE) - Delete a document
   - `/api/knowledge-base/documents/[id]` - Get documents for a KB

2. **n8n Webhook Triggers**:
   - `/webhook/upload-doc` - After file upload
   - `/webhook/upload-url` - After URL/sitemap addition

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Operations**:
   - Bulk document deletion
   - Batch status updates

2. **Enhanced Document Management**:
   - Preview functionality for documents
   - Document editing capabilities
   - Embedding refresh

3. **Advanced Filtering & Search**:
