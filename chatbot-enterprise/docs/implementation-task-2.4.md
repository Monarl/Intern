# Task 2.4: Knowledge Base Management Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **API Endpoints Implementation**:
   - Created and enhanced API routes for knowledge base management:
     - `GET /api/knowledge-base/list`: List knowledge bases
     - `DELETE /api/knowledge-base/[id]`: Delete a knowledge base and all related content
     - `POST /api/knowledge-base/upload-file`: Upload file to a knowledge base
     - `POST /api/knowledge-base/upload-url`: Add URL or sitemap to a knowledge base
     - `DELETE /api/knowledge-base/document/[id]`: Delete a specific document

2. **Storage Setup**:
   - Created `chatbot-documents` bucket in Supabase Storage
   - Set file size limit to 20MB
   - Configured allowed file types: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV

3. **File Upload Process**:
   - Implemented file validation (size, type)
   - Stored files with proper path format: `<kb_name>/<filename>`
   - Created document records in the database
   - Triggered n8n webhook for document processing

4. **URL Processing**:
   - Added URL validation
   - Implemented sitemap detection
   - Created document records for URLs
   - Triggered n8n webhook for web content processing

5. **Deletion Logic**:
   - Implemented document deletion with storage cleanup
   - Implemented knowledge base deletion with cascading cleanup

6. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Restricted access to Super Admin and Knowledge Manager roles
   - Added proper permission checks on all endpoints

7. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed API documentation in `docs/knowledge-base-api.md`
   - Updated project README.md with knowledge base features
   - Added testing utilities in `tests/api/` directory

## Testing Utilities

1. **Postman Collection**:
   - Created `tests/api/knowledge-base-api-tests.json` for manual API testing
   - Included all endpoints with example request bodies

2. **Automated Tests**:
   - Created `tests/api/knowledge-base-api.test.ts` with test cases
   - Mock implementations for testing without live dependencies

## Integration with n8n

The API endpoints trigger two n8n webhooks:
- `/webhook/upload-doc` for file processing
- `/webhook/upload-url` for URL/sitemap processing

The webhooks receive:
- `path`: Storage path for files, empty for URLs
- `file_name`: Filename for files, URL for web content
- `knowledge_base_id`: UUID of the knowledge base
- `is_sitemap`: Boolean flag for sitemap URLs (URL uploads only)

## Next Steps

- Implement the frontend components for knowledge base management
- Add progress tracking for document processing
- Enhance error handling and retry mechanisms
- Add batch operations for file uploads
